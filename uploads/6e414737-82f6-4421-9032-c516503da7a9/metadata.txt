Content of questions.txt:
Use the undirected network in `edges.csv`.
Return a JSON object with keys:
- `edge_count`: number
- `highest_degree_node`: string
- `average_degree`: number
- `density`: number
- `shortest_path_alice_eve`: number
- `network_graph`: base64 PNG string under 100kB
- `degree_histogram`: base64 PNG string under 100kB
Answer:
1. How many edges are in the network?
2. Which node has the highest degree?
3. What is the average degree of the network?
4. What is the network density?
5. What is the length of the shortest path between Alice and Eve?
6. Draw the network with nodes labelled and edges shown. Encode as base64 PNG.
7. Plot the degree distribution as a bar chart with green bars. Encode as base64 PNG.

JSON Answer Format for subsequent tasks: The final answer to the user's query should be in JSON format, if applicable, as specified by the task's output schema.
